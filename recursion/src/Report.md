Recursive Fibonacci multiplies the amount of work at each step, leading to exponential time, O(2ⁿ), and very slow execution for large inputs. Iterative Fibonacci, by contrast, moves through the sequence once, giving linear time, O(n), and remains efficient. In linked lists, inserting recursively creates a call for every node, incurring O(n) stack overhead, while the iterative method keeps a single call frame, O(1), and usually runs faster. Recursion can be neat and expressive, but iteration tends to be more practical and performant in Java, which doesn’t optimize tail calls.
